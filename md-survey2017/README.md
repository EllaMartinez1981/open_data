# MENA Devs Survey (2017)
## Abstract

As professional Software Engineers, Technical Managers and CTOs we frequently look for data to help us assess the status of the Software Engineering industry in **Lebanon and the region**, but we constantly fail to find significant and reliable sources.

In short, as a collective of professionals in this industry, it is our duty develop a data set that will benefit us all.

We have taken it upon ourselves to create a short survey tailored for the professionals in our domain to collect data, analyze it and extract insights.

**The survey was published the first of June 2017 and ran until the end of June 2017, here is the raw data collected.**

The list of questions asked in the survey is available in: `raw_data/QUESTIONS_MDS2017.md`
